# Diffusion Models on Graphs with HydraGNN 
Welcome to our Diffusion Model repository! üéâ This project builds on HydraGNN, leveraging its powerful GNN and ML utilities for training, testing, and model optimization. We've added diffusion modeling on graphs to explore new horizons in graph-based learning. üöÄ

## Features
    * Graph Neural Networks (GNN): Utilizing HydraGNN's robust GNN architecture for effective graph modeling. 
    * Diffusion Modeling: Enhanced with diffusion processes to capture complex graph dynamics. 
    * Parallelization & Optimization: Effortlessly scale with multi-GPU support and optimized training routines! ‚ö°

## Quick Start
Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/diffusion-gnn.git
cd diffusion-gnn
```

### Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have the HydraGNN environment set up:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Training:
```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

## How It Works
HydraGNN integration üåä: We utilize the operational utilities from HydraGNN, such as model training, testing, and optimization, to simplify workflow.
Diffusion Process: Modeled on graph structures to simulate the propagation of information or features across the graph nodes. Perfect for dynamic systems! 
Model Parallelization: Thanks to HydraGNN, training large models with multi-GPU support is integrated.

### Ô∏èConfiguration
All model and training parameters can be easily set via our config.json file:

```json
model:
  type: diffusion_gnn
  layers: 5
  hidden_dim: 128
train:
  epochs: 100
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.001
```
